# js-player
a javascript video player

basically it get framed images and render as video. 

#to-dos:
1) image sources are hard-coded for now. it should be a parameter.
2) fps and other parameters hard coded for now. these should be parameters also.
* actually these are defined as variables just need to get as parameter
